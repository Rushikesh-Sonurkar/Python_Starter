🚀 Day 1 – What Is Programming & Python?

💡 What Is Programming?

Imagine your computer as a super-fast assistant... but one that doesn’t understand human language until you speak to it in code.
Programming is how we give step-by-step instructions to machines to perform tasks—from simple math to automating entire workflows.
Sure, you can mentally solve 5 + 6 = 11 in a flash. But try multiplying 23,453,453 × 56,456—you’ll be reaching for a calculator, right?
That’s the power of programming: taking tasks that are boring, repetitive, or beyond human scale and handing them to machines. And guess what? You don’t need to be a genius to do it. You just need clarity, curiosity, and consistency.
This 100-day journey will take you from zero to job-ready in Python, one day at a time. 🎯

🐍 What Is Python?

Python is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages. 
It’s flexible, elegant, and incredibly readable—almost like writing plain English with logic.

Paradigms: Supports both object-oriented and functional programming
Invented by: Guido van Rossum in 1989
Execution: Interpreted and high-level

⚙️ Key Features of Python
